# Newlang2
The last language I created was "LISP" based that was a much simple line by line execution based (list based ) language 
But this time i am going to make a language thats comparable to professtional level it will be interpreted via 2 different method 
1 using a Java based interpreter that can work using the JVM 
2 using the classic C language but i would try to use C++ instead 
this is because i wanna make this into an experience how using c++ for a project
